Loading Instructions:
Option 1. In base directory, locate the folder for your current operating system (Windows, Mac). Inside that folder, run Assignment1.exe.

Option 2. Open Assignment1.uproject in Unreal Engine. The project should load into the Menu level, but if not, open that level to start. Use Unrealâ€™s native compiler to run the game (push the play button at the top of the screen).
